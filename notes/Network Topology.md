# ðŸ’» Network Topology 

- Where the type defines the network scope,  
- The topology describes the physical or logical structure of the network in terms of nodes and links.  
- A network's physical topology describes the placement of nodes and how they are connected by the transmission media.  
- For example, in one network, nodes might be directly connected via a single cable;  
- In another network, each node might connect to a switching appliance via separate cables.  
- These two networks have different physical topologies.  
- The logical topology describes the flow of data through the network.  
- For example, given the different physical network topologies described previously,  
- If in each case the nodes can send messages to one another, the logical topology is the same.  
- The different physical implementationsâ€”directly connected via a cable versus connected to the same switchâ€”achieve the same logical layout.  
- In the simplest type of topology, a single link is established between two nodes.  
- This is called a point-to-point link.  
- Because only two devices share the connection, they are guaranteed a level of bandwidth.
