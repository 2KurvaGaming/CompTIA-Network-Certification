# 🦖 Network Types 
- A ***network type*** refers primarily to its size and scope.
- The size of a network can be measured as the number of nodes, while the scope refers to the area over which nodes sharing the same network address are distributed.
## ⭐ Local Area Networks
  - A local area network (LAN) is confined to a single geographical location. In a LAN, all nodes and segments are directly connected with cables or short-range wireless technologies. 
      - Most of the network infrastructure in a LAN would be directly owned and managed by a single organization
      - Some examples of LANs include the following:
- Home/residential network—With an Internet router and a few computers, plus mobile devices, gaming consoles, and printers.
- Small office/home office (SOHO) network—A business-oriented network possibly using a centralized server in addition to client devices and printers, but often still       using a single Internet router/switch/access point to provide connectivity.
- Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) Network—A network supporting dozens of users. Such networks would use structured cabling and multiple switches and routers to provide connectivity.
- Enterprise LAN—A larger network with hundreds or thousands of servers and clients. Such networks would require multiple enterprise-class switch and router appliances to maintain performance levels.
- Datacenter—A network that hosts only servers and storage, not end user client devices.

# 🖥️ Client-Server vs. 🤝 Peer-to-Peer Networks 
## 👉 **End system nodes** can be classified as either clients or servers:

- A ***server*** makes network applications and resources available to other hosts.
- A ***client*** consumes the services provided by servers.

## ⚙️ Wide Area Networks
- A wide area network (WAN) is a network of networks, connected by long-distance links. A typical enterprise WAN would connect a main office site with multiple branch office sites, possibly in different countries.
- A WAN could link two or more large LANs or could be used for remote workers connecting to an enterprise network via a public network such as the Internet.
- WAN links are also used to connect datacenters to one another.
- WANs are likely to use leased network devices and links, operated and managed by a service provider.
