# üíª Networking Concepts 
- A ***Network*** is two or more computer systems that are linked by a transmission medium and share one or more protocols that enable them to exchange data.
- You can think of any network in terms of nodes and links. The nodes are devices that send, receive, and forward data, and the links are the communications pathways between them.
## ‚≠ê 2 General Kinds of Nodes
  - Intermediate Nodes and End Systems
      - Intermediate nodes perform a forwarding function, while end system nodes are those that send and receive data traffic.
      - End systems are often also referred to as hosts.

# üñ•Ô∏è Client-Server vs. ü§ù Peer-to-Peer Networks 
End system nodes can be classified as either clients or servers:

- A ***server*** makes network applications and resources available to other hosts.
- A ***client*** consumes the services provided by servers.

- A **client-server network** is one where some nodes, such as PCs, laptops, and smartphones, act mostly as clients.
- The servers are more powerful computers. Application services and resources are centrally provisioned, managed, and secured.

- A **peer-to-peer network** is one where each host acts as both client and server.
- This is a decentralized model where provision, management, and security of services and data are distributed around the network.
- A small peer-to-peer network can also be referred to as a workgroup.

- Business and enterprise networks are typically client-server, while residential networks are more often peer-to-peer. However, note that in a client-server network, often, hosts will function as both clients and       servers at the same time. For example, a computer hosting a web application acts as a server to browser clients but is itself a client of database services running on other server computers. It is the centrally       administered nature of the network that really defines it as client-server.
# Appliances, Applications, and Functions
üí°You can also think of a network as having appliances, applications, and functions:

- üü™ Appliances‚ÄîNetworks make use of many types of specialized platforms. Unlike general-purpose Windows or macOS computers and servers, an appliance is a computer with an operating system and software designed to perform a particular network role. 
- Examples of these roles ***include the switches, routers, and wireless access points*** that forward data, the firewalls and intrusion detection systems that enforce security rules, and the load balancers and proxies that improve network performance.

‚≠ê An appliance can be deployed as physical hardware, meaning that the appliance OS/software runs on its own CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces.
- It is also possible to deploy virtual appliances.
  - It is also possible to deploy virtual appliances.
  - The same hypervisor computer could run multiple virtual appliances.
      
üëâ Applications 
- The nodes and links of the networking infrastructure are deployed to run services.
  - Services are shared applications that allow the network to do useful work, such as sharing files or allowing employees to send email.
          
üëâ Functions
- Networks can be configured with additional properties to perform different functions.
  - For example, the security properties of a virtual private network allow devices to join a local network from across the Internet.
  - As another example, quality of service functionality allows optimization of a network to suit a particularly time-sensitive application, such as voice or video
